Past Year Review 24/25
     ChatGPT with context from Åndrei
      This year did not begin with failure. It
       began with surface. We saw activity
    everywhere: tools in motion, dashboards
   updated, meetings filled, and tasks moving.
  But the more we looked, the more we realized
how much of this movement was not grounded in
    substance. What we were seeing was not
   necessarily work. It was the shape of work,
          performed. It was simulation.




                      1
 This pattern wasn’t accidental. It came from
  the culture we operate in. A culture where
 being seen to work is often more important
than doing meaningful work. Where polish is
  more valuable than follow-through. Where
 appearing aligned has replaced the effort of
            actual understanding.




                      2
Much of modern tech and creative work now
    functions like a cargo cult. People go
through the motions of contribution without
engaging in the deeper logic. They adopt the
 form of progress in hopes that real results
      will follow. Teams meet to simulate
     coordination. Roles exist to suggest
structure. People produce artifacts that look
 like outcomes. But often, there’s no weight
              to what is being done.




                      3
 This dynamic is reinforced by the platforms
 around us. Artists, developers, and workers
 of all kinds are rewarded for the appearance
 of doing — not the consequences of what’s
    been done. Social media teaches us to
   simulate creativity. Project tools train us
to simulate productivity. Team culture begins
  to drift toward performance and away from
                    presence.




                      4
  As newer generations enter the field, many
  inherit this framework not as a workaround
  but as the default. They learn roles through
 content, not through mentorship. They inherit
 formats without understanding context. They
   know how contribution looks before they
    understand what contribution feels like.
Simulation becomes the standard. The wrapper
              becomes the product.



                      5
   This mindset has infected the workplace.
Meetings become performative rituals. Hand-
offs are aesthetic but ungrounded. People are
  hired based on the glow of a profile or the
    cadence of their answers, not on their
 ability to contribute with rhythm and clarity
      in real time. And yet, the cost of this
       simulation is high. Teams that look
   productive but aren’t grounded fall apart
    under pressure. Projects that are over-
    structured but under-owned drift until
     failure. Work that is visible but vague
                   erodes trust.




                      6
   This year, we began resisting. Not loudly.
     Not dramatically. But deliberately. We
stepped away from ritual performance. We paid
  attention to what actually held. We reduced
noise. We dropped tasks that looked good and
 did nothing. We asked questions like: Who is
  this really for? What are we avoiding? What
       would it take to actually solve this?



                      7
  One of the most useful metaphors this year
came from an unexpected place: the ninja. Not
  as costume, not as fantasy, but as method.
   The ninja isn’t defined by flash. The ninja
    is defined by repetition, by mastery, by
     doing the hard thing without seeking
 recognition. A ninja trains even when no one
    watches. A ninja holds to values not as
 decoration but as discipline. A ninja doesn’t
      vibe with loyalty. A ninja proves it in
                     motion.




                      8
    The ninja path is the opposite of cargo
      ritual. It’s about consistency under
 pressure. It’s about doing things right when
     no one will see, because that’s what
   sustains. It’s about values being earned
through experience, not merely stated. Values
  are not real until they’re tested. Not every
   day is dramatic. Not every task is visible.
  But commitment builds through repetition.




                      9
  Another lesson this year: being specific is
        not just about detail. It is about
 orientation. To be specific is to always know
 what you are doing, why you’re doing it, and
       how it fits. Specificity is structural.
    Without it, ownership fades. Without it,
meetings grow vague and long. When people are
      not specific, simulation fills the gap.
   Specificity is a form of respect — for the
    problem, the people, and the time being
                       spent.




                      10
  We also learned that ownership is always
       questionable. It moves. It ages. It
   disappears. And that’s not a flaw. That’s
   reality. Ownership isn’t a badge — it’s a
relationship between a person and a task in a
 moment of time. Because it’s fragile, it must
  be maintained. Made visible. Re-declared.
   Checked. When ownership is implicit, it
 decays. When it’s explicit, it can be tested,
   shared, and adjusted. Good teams treat
 ownership as living structure — something
  that can flex, but never disappear silently.




                      11
Above all, we saw that the most valuable work
 begins after the performance ends. It begins
when people stop pretending to know and start
  asking together. When they stop optimizing
   for how things look and start noticing how
 things feel. When they stop performing roles
and begin inhabiting them. The work that held
    this year was not fast. It was not loud. It
    was not always polished. But it was real.




                      12
   We leave this year not with performance
 metrics, but with deeper orientation. We are
 here to build slowly if needed, clearly when
  possible, and honestly at all times. We are
  here to ask the hard questions when they
matter. We are here to work as a team, not to
simulate one. We are here not to impress, but
 to endure. Because what holds over time is
    not the glow, not the wrapper, not the
narrative. What holds is what’s built through
        attention, repetition, and trust.




                     13
   That is the path forward. Not a vibe. A
 practice. Not a promise. A pattern. Not a
role. A rhythm. We’re walking it. And we’re
                   staying.
